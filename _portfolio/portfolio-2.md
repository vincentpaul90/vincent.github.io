This project showcases data handling and visualization techniques from the paper "Surface plasmon enhanced fast electron emission from metallised fibre optic nanotips." Key points include:

### Data Cleaning
1. **Calibration**: Regular checks on the onset of field emission potential to ensure nanotip integrity and smooth data flow.
2. **Outlier Handling**: Excluding data points with visible nanotip coating damage.

### Data Processing
1. **Spectral Measurements**: Utilizing a monochromator to measure photonic responses.
2. **FDTD Simulation**: Modeling the plasmonic response of the nanotip using Finite Difference Time Domain computations.

### Data Analysis
1. **Power Law Analysis**: Fitting electron emission data to a power law model.
2. **Resonance Characterization**: Identifying spectral resonance peaks in electron emission.
3. **Emission Mechanism Identification**: Differentiating between multi-photon and thermionic emission.

### Data Visualization
1. **Field Intensity Patterns**: Visualizing calculated field intensity at the nanotip.
2. **Emission Spectra**: Plotting wavelength-dependent electron emission rates and power law orders.
3. **Simulation Results**: Displaying FDTD simulation results of the nanotip's plasmonic response.
