This project focuses on the interaction between the probe and the sample surface in apertureless scanning-probe optical microscopy. Key points include:

### Data Analytics
1. **Field Approximation**: Using quasi-electrostatic analytics to approximate the field in the nanometer-scale region between the probe tip and the sample.

### Modeling
2. **Probe Modeling**: Modeling the coated probe as a hyperboloid of revolution without hyperboloidal wave functions in the near zone.

### Visualization
3. **Analytical Solutions**: Solutions to Laplace’s equation and Green’s function, applying boundary conditions to achieve analytical solutions for resonance effects on the probe tip.

This project utilizes advanced data analytics, precise modeling techniques, and detailed visualizations to explore and present the complex interactions at the nanoscale level.
