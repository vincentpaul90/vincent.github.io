## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is the [Heart Disease dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. This script uses the Cleveland dataset, which has been used for most of the experiments.
