Education
======
* Ph.D in Electrical Engineering (Analytics & Simulation), University of Tennessee, TN 2019 
* M.S. in Medical Physics, University of Tennessee, TN 2014
* Associate Degree  in Biomedical Sciences, GSB Chandigarh, India 2011

## Work Experience

* **Sr. Business Analyst**
    * Utilized analytical models to analyze longitudinal client metrics and benefits management data, delivering valuable insights to senior leadership for the development of effective medical benefits solutions.
    * Conducted statistical analyses on intervention data (clinical and behavioral) to assess treatment efficacy, safety, and overall study outcomes.
    * Provided support in the creation of CONSORT diagrams and recruitment charts for internal review board (IRB) assessments, facilitating transparent reporting and effective evaluation of study processes.
    * Developed and executed NLP machine learning models to conduct sentiment analysis, classification, and provider segmentation utilizing Medicare and Medicaid member reviews.

* **Data Scientist**
    * Employed propensity score matching to balance covariates between patients who received the laser scalpel surgical device and those who did not, controlling for potential confounding variables and ensuring a more accurate comparison of outcomes.
    * Conducted sensitivity and specificity analyses to assess the robustness of the results to different assumptions or methodological choices, ensuring the reliability of the findings in evaluating the effectiveness of the laser scalpel surgical device.
    * Developed RUL (Remaining Useful Life) estimation models and survival models to create prognostic models predicting when failures are likely to occur, preventing unplanned downtime.

* **Data Analyst (Medical Device Data)**
    * Performed power analysis for sample size calculation to determine the number of units to be tested, ensuring statistical reliability and accuracy of quality testing.
    * Implemented statistical control charts to reduce process variability by 25% and enhance the operational efficiency of the medical device manufacturing process.
    * Developed a composite indicator of manufacturing efficiency to rank multiple processing lines and ensure uniform efficiency across all lines.
